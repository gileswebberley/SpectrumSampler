Spectrum Sampler - First project coding with c++ and using openFrameworks.
I have a deep passion for listening to music and back in the 90s I thoroughly enjoyed the early music visualisations but found they didn't seem to hear the music like I did. When I discovered the FFT capabilities in OF I researched how they worked and what the data signified (understanding the basics of "buckets"). To practice with the idea of VBOs I created an extension of the tutorial project in the OF Book and made the mesh react to music (I would love to extend this to live music feeds rather than just music files). I spent many hours tweaking the reactions until I could listen to all sorts of music and see it visualised in a way that I would do it if I was controlling it by hand. There is a very simple beat detection system. If you would like to play with it simply make this an OF project and add your music files to the data folder. There is a kind of Jukebox system within the project which allows you skip tracks and play random tracks or specific tracks (check out the code for the keys to use for controls). Unfortunately I ended up creating another huge class that does everything, there are a few examples of me trying to create reuseable modules but my OOP is still poor when I try to put the theory into practise, but I hope it will improve when I get to work with people who are used to implementing it in their own development. As always, any feedback is warmly appreciated.
